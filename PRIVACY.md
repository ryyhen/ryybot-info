# Ryybot Privacy Policy
## Collection of data
User data is collected when provided by the user to configure the behavior of the bot via commands. The information collected includes the configuration data provided by the user in the command, the user's discord ID, and the channel and guild the command was used in. Only the minimum required configuration data is stored.

Certain commands may also request message content data for recent messages in the channel at the request of the user. The collected message content data for such commands is only used to process the command and for no other purpose. Upon completion of the command, message content data is immediately discarded.

The guild administrator can configure the bot to automatically manage specific channels, which may include collecting user data, including message content data. Message content data collected this way only occurs for messages sent in the specific configured channels. The message content data is used only to complete behavior configured by the guild administrator. The message content data is discarded immediately afterwards.

Additionally, for the proper functionion of the bot, the bot monitors various events and responds to them as configured by users. As a result, the bot will incidentially receive data not relevant to the bot's operation. Any events that are not relevant to any configured features are discarded.

## Storage of data
User provided data is securely stored and access controlled such that only the bot and the bot developer have access to the data.

Only the minimum required configuration data is stored. This data includes the data provided by the user, the user's discord ID, and the channel and guild the command was used in. Data that is no longer relevant to the functionality of the bot is deleted.

Message content data is never stored.

## Removal of data
Any user provided configuration data can be removed by using the same command used to initially configure the bot. Please see the relevant commands for further information.
